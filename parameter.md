# Parameter

In [statistics](statistics.md), a **parameter** is a numerical value that describes a characteristic of a [population](population.md). It reflects the true value for the entire group under study, such as the average weight of all dairy cows in a region, the proportion of infected animals in a herd, or the standard deviation of blood glucose levels in a population of dogs. Because parameters refer to entire populations, they are usually unknown and cannot be measured directly unless a complete census is performed. Instead, parameters are estimated using data from a [sample](sample.md) and serve as the foundation for [inferential statistics](inferential-statistics.md). 

## Relationship with statistic

Parameters and [statistics](statistic.md) are closely related in the logic of statistical inference. A parameter describes a characteristic of a population, while a statistic is the corresponding value calculated from a sample. Because researchers rarely have access to entire populations, statistics are used to estimate parameters and support generalizations about the population.

Although parameters and statistics describe the same types of characteristics —such as means, proportions, and standard deviations—they differ in both their source (population vs. sample) and notation. The table below shows common examples:

| Characteristic | Parameter (population) | Statistic (sample) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Size (number of units) | 𝑁 | 𝑛 |
| Mean | μ (mu) | 𝑥̅ (x-bar) |
| Proportion | P | 𝑝̅ (p-hat) |
| Standard deviation | σ (sigma) | s |
| Variance | σ² | s² |

While parameters are theoretical values that describe entire populations, statistics are calculated from sample data and serve as estimates of those parameters. This relationship forms the foundation of inferential statistics, which uses sample information to draw conclusions about broader populations.
