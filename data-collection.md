# Data collection

**Data collection** is the process of gathering and recording [data](data.md) from various sources. This process aims to answer a specific research question or fulfill a defined objective. In [veterinary biostatistics](veterinary-biostatistics.md), the quality of the data collected directly influences the validity of research findings and clinical decisions. A structured and purposeful approach to data collection ensures that the information obtained is relevant, accurate, and suitable for analysis. The basic logic of data collection can be visualized as a flow from data sources to data record, mediated by a systematic collection process.

## Purpose and importance

Before collecting data, it is essential to clearly define the research question, objective, or problem being investigated. This step ensures that the data gathered are appropriate and meaningful. Researchers must also identify which [variables](variable.md) to measure, determine the types of data to collect, and select suitable [scales of measurement](scales-of-measurement.md)—such as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. These decisions guide how data are recorded, organized, and analyzed, and they influence the choice of tools and methods used for data collection. The result of a well-planned data collection process is a dataset, which is a structured collection of related data points often arranged in rows and columns. A data point is an individual unit of information that represents a particular value as a result of an observation or measurement. For example, a single data point in a dataset is the body temperature of a cow on a particular day, whereas a complete dataset might contain hundreds or thousands of such records across different animals, time points, or farms.

## Data sources

A data source refers to any entity, system, or environment that generates observable or measurable facts. These sources may be natural or artificial, depending on their origin. Natural data sources come from environmental or biological systems. They include phenomena such as weather conditions, animal behavior, or physiological responses. For example, observing the grazing patterns of sheep during different weather conditions, recording respiratory rates in calves during transport, or tracking the migration routes of wild birds are all based on natural data sources.

Artificial data sources, in contrast, are human-created systems that generate data through interactions, transactions, or automated outputs. In general settings, these include social media platforms that produce user interaction metrics, online shopping websites that produce transaction log, or web analytics tools that capture browsing patterns. In veterinary contexts, artificial data sources may include automated feeding systems that generate logs of feed dispensing events, radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based animal tracking systems that generate movement data, or wearable devices that continuously produce physiological data. These systems produce data as part of ongoing processes and their outputs become the raw material for statistical analysis.

## Methods

Data collection methods in veterinary studies can be broadly categorized as manual or automated. Manual data collection involves direct human effort to record observations and measurements, often in field or clinical settings. A common example is when a researcher observes the behavior of animals and records findings by hand in a notebook. Similarly, a veterinary public health surveyor may conduct interviews with livestock owners and document responses using paper forms. Although manual methods allow for contextual understanding and flexibility, they are also prone to human error and may be time-consuming.

Automated data collection uses technology to systematically and often continuously capture data with minimal human involvement. For instance, sensors installed in barns can record temperature or humidity at regular intervals. Wearable devices attached to animals may monitor heart rate, step count, rumination patterns, or body position, transmitting data in real time to digital systems. Automated feeding systems may log the timing and quantity of feed delivery, while environmental monitors may track air quality or noise levels. These automated systems improve efficiency, reduce human bias, and allow for the collection of large volumes of data over extended periods.

Some types of data collection do not fit neatly into either manual or automated category. Multimedia data, such as photos, videos, or audio recordings, often involve both manual and automated elements. For example, a motion-triggered camera might automatically record video footage of a piglet pen, but reviewing the footage to assess behavior such as nursing or aggression may require manual interpretation. In other cases, software tools such as image recognition or acoustic analysis can assist with automated interpretation. Because these processes combine automated capture with manual or semi-automated analysis, multimedia data are often considered a hybrid or semi-automated form of data collection.

## Validity and reliability

The quality of collected data depends not only on how it is gathered, but also on its validity and reliability.

Validity refers to whether a measurement truly reflects the concept it is intended to measure. For example, if a researcher uses heart rate to assess stress in animals, the validity of this measure depends on whether heart rate is a true indicator of stress in that species and context. Using the wrong variable, instrument, or measurement scale can reduce validity and lead to misleading conclusions. Validity can be further classified into different types—such as content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity—but the central question is whether the data are suitable and meaningful for answering the research question.

Reliability refers to the consistency of a measurement. A measurement is considered reliable if it produces the same result when repeated under the same conditions. For example, if different observers assess body condition score (BCS) for the same animal and produce different results, the measurement is not reliable. Similarly, a weighing scale that gives different results for the same animal within a short period may be unreliable due to mechanical problems or poor calibration.

Both validity and reliability are essential for drawing trustworthy conclusions. High reliability does not guarantee validity—a scale may be consistent but still inaccurate. However, low reliability always undermines the usefulness of the data. Researchers can improve reliability by calibrating instruments, training observers, using standardized protocols, and repeating measurements when appropriate. Validity can be improved by selecting appropriate indicators and checking them against known standards or expected outcomes. Understanding and addressing validity and reliability helps ensure that data are not only consistent but also meaningful—a critical foundation for high-quality veterinary research.

## Primary and secondary data

Data can also be classified as primary or secondary, based on their origin and intended use. Primary data are collected directly by the investigator for a specific purpose, using methods such as observations, measurements, surveys, interviews, or laboratory testing. For example, collecting fecal samples from a herd to investigate parasitic infection levels is a form of primary data collection. Because the researcher controls how and why the data are collected, primary data can be tailored to meet specific study needs and quality standards.

Secondary data, by contrast, are previously collected for other purposes and later repurposed for new analysis. An example of secondary data is the use of national livestock census records to examine regional patterns of disease incidence. Secondary data are often more accessible and cost-effective than collecting new data, but they may be limited in detail, completeness, or compatibility with the current research question. Researchers must evaluate secondary sources critically to ensure their suitability for the intended analysis.

## Sampling and representativeness

In most veterinary studies, it is impractical or impossible to collect data from every individual in the population of interest. Instead, researchers collect information from a sample—a subset of the population selected to represent the whole. Ideally, the sample should reflect the characteristics and variability of the broader population. This representativeness is essential for drawing valid conclusions and making generalizations using statistical methods. Careful sampling design helps reduce bias and increases the usefulness of the findings beyond the sample itself.

However, not all studies aim for representativeness in the traditional sense. In certain types of research—particularly those designed to demonstrate freedom from infection or to detect disease presence—the focus may shift to risk-based sampling. In such studies, the goal is not to estimate disease prevalence across the population, but rather to increase the likelihood of detecting disease if it exists. This is achieved by intentionally selecting units (e.g., animals, herds, or locations) that have a higher risk of infection, such as those with recent outbreaks, high animal movement, or poor biosecurity. These samples may not be representative, but they are chosen strategically to enhance sensitivity, or the ability to detect disease when it is present.

The appropriate sampling approach depends on the research objective. When the goal is to estimate proportions or other numerical values for the general population, representativeness is crucial. In contrast, surveillance and early detection studies often benefit more from targeted, risk-based strategies.

## Recorded data

The goal of data collection is to produce recorded data that can be stored, accessed, and analyzed effectively. Based on how they are formatted and stored, recorded data are usually classified as either structured or unstructured. Structured data are organized into predefined formats with clearly defined variables and records. These data are often stored in spreadsheets, databases, or coded forms. Each row represents an individual unit (such as an animal or a visit) and each column represents a variable (such as age, breed, or diagnosis). Examples of structured data include clinical laboratory results entered into electronic health records, herd performance data stored in spreadsheets, or coded responses from surveys. Structured data are useful for statistical analysis because they can be easily managed and processed using standard software tools.

Unstructured data, by contrast, do not follow a standard format and do not fit neatly into tabular or relational formats. These data may include free-text clinical notes, handwritten field records, diagnostic images, audio recordings, or video footage. Unstructured data are often collected in their raw, natural form and may contain rich contextual or qualitative information. However, they often require additional steps—such as cleaning, coding, or computational processing—before they can be analyzed. Advanced tools like natural language processing, image recognition, or machine learning algorithms are sometimes used to extract meaningful information from unstructured data. In veterinary research, unstructured data are becoming increasingly common due to the growing use of digital imaging, remote sensing, and multimedia monitoring.

Both types of data have value. Structured data are easier to analyze using traditional statistical techniques, while unstructured data can provide deeper insights—especially in clinical, behavioral, or environmental studies. Understanding the format and complexity of recorded data is important for selecting the right tools and methods for analysis.

## Ethical and practical considerations

Data collection in veterinary medicine involves both practical challenges and ethical responsibilities that can influence the quality and credibility of the data. Common practical issues include measurement error, missing values, and observer bias.

- Measurement error may occur when instruments are inaccurate or when observations are inconsistently recorded. For example, if a thermometer is not calibrated correctly, it may report higher-than-actual body temperatures in calves, leading to incorrect classification. Similarly, different observers may assign different body condition scores to the same animal, causing inconsistency in the dataset.

- Missing or incomplete data are also a frequent problem, especially in field-based studies. A researcher might be unable to collect samples from all animals due to equipment failure, animal stress, or poor weather conditions. These gaps can reduce the reliability of the results and may introduce bias if the missing data are not random.

- Observer bias happens when the researcher’s expectations influence data recording. For example, if a veterinarian conducting a clinical trial knows which animals received a new treatment, they might—consciously or unconsciously—record more favorable outcomes for animals in that group. Training observers and using blinding procedures can help reduce this risk.

In addition to these practical concerns, ethical considerations are central to the data collection process. When studies involve privately owned animals or commercial farms, researchers must obtain informed consent from the owners or caretakers. Participants should be informed about the study’s purpose, scope, and potential risks. Confidentiality must be protected, particularly when the data include personal identifiers, geographic locations, or production records. For example, publication of farm-level productivity data should not reveal names or coordinates unless explicit permission has been granted.

Animal welfare must also be prioritized. Data collection protocols should be designed to minimize stress, discomfort, and harm to animals. In an observational study of lameness in dairy cows, for instance, repeated handling or excessive restraint may negatively affect animal welfare if not carefully managed. In an experimental study, such as testing a new vaccine, ethical concerns may arise from procedures like blood sampling, injections, or intentional exposure of animals to pathogens. These procedures must be scientifically justified and carried out with safeguards to protect animal health. Ethical review boards, such as Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs), are responsible for reviewing study designs to ensure that they meet accepted standards for humane treatment, scientific validity, and transparency.
