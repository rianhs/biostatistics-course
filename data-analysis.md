# Data analysis

**Data analysis** is the process of examining and summarizing collected [data](data.md) to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. It allows researchers to make sense of observations, test hypotheses, and assess the structure and variability within the data. In [veterinary biostatistics](veterinary-biostatistics.md), data analysis is essential for understanding disease patterns, evaluating treatment outcomes, and monitoring animal health at both individual and population levels. This step relies on well-collected and properly organized data, and it requires the thoughtful selection of statistical methods suited to the study design and type of variables involved. Data analysis also serves as a vital bridge between [data organization](data-organization.md) and [data interpretation](data-interpretation.md), turning raw data into insights that can inform clinical decisions and scientific conclusions.

## Purpose and importance

The main purpose of data analysis is to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can answer research questions, test scientific hypotheses, and support evidence-based decision-making. Without analysis, even high-quality data remain uninformative. Through proper analytical techniques, researchers can detect patterns, measure differences, and explore relationships that may not be immediately apparent in the unprocessed dataset.

Data analysis can be grouped based on the number of variables being examined. Univariate analysis focuses on a single variable—such as summarizing the birth weights of piglets—to describe its distributional properties such as center, spread, or shape. Bivariate analysis looks at the relationship between two variables—for example, examining whether feed intake is associated with body weight. Multivariate analysis involves more than two variables at once and is particularly useful in veterinary research, where outcomes—such as treatment success, milk production, or infection risk—are often influenced by multiple factors including age, breed, environmental conditions, or management practices. Choosing the appropriate type of analysis depends on the research question, the data structure, and the intended conclusions.

## Descriptive analysis

Descriptive analysis involves summarizing data to highlight the key characteristics of a dataset. It does not aim to make generalizations beyond the data collected but instead provides a clear snapshot of what the data show. This includes measures of central tendency—such as the mean, median, and mode—which help describe where the center of the data lies. It also includes measures of variability—such as range, standard deviation, and interquartile range—which describe how spread out the data are. In veterinary studies, descriptive summaries are used to report values like average body temperature, most common diagnoses, or day-to-day changes in barn temperature. These summaries help identify outliers, understand data quality, and prepare the dataset for further analysis.

Descriptive analysis also includes visual tools that make complex data easier to interpret. Graphs such as bar charts, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are widely used to display distributions, trends, and potential relationships. These visualizations complement numerical summaries and allow for quick insights, making them especially useful in both scientific reports and communication with non-specialist audiences. Descriptive statistics are often the first step in any analysis. They provide essential context, help researchers check for data errors or unusual values, and lay the groundwork for selecting suitable statistical tests during the inferential phase.

## Inferential analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Main article: [Inferential statistics](inferential-statistics.md)*

Inferential analysis involves using data from a sample to draw conclusions about a larger population. It includes two core activities: estimating population values and testing hypotheses. For example, researchers may estimate the average body temperature of cats in a region based on a sample, or test whether treatment outcomes differ between two medication groups. These inferences are based on probability theory and always involve a degree of uncertainty, typically expressed through confidence intervals or p-values. In general, larger and more consistent samples yield more precise and reliable results.

A wide range of statistical tests is available depending on the research question, type of data, and study design. Some tests are used to compare groups—such as t-tests, chi-square tests, or ANOVA—while others assess relationships between variables—such as correlation or regression. Each test comes with assumptions, such as normally distributed data or equal variance across groups. These tests can be parametric (requiring stricter assumptions) or non-parametric (more flexible but sometimes less powerful). Selecting the correct test depends on factors such as sample size, variable type, and measurement scale. When applied correctly, inferential statistics allow veterinary researchers to make informed, evidence-based decisions and assess whether observed differences or associations are likely to reflect real patterns in the broader population.

## Statistical modeling

Statistical modeling is a more advanced form of analysis that explores complex relationships among variables. It is used to predict outcomes, estimate effects, adjust for confounding factors, and describe patterns that go beyond simple comparisons. While traditional inferential methods test specific hypotheses, statistical models can account for complex interactions among several factors.

In veterinary research, linear regression is commonly used to predict continuous outcomes—such as predicting daily milk yield based on age, breed, and feed composition. Logistic regression is used when the outcome is binary, such as determining whether an animal is infected or not, based on vaccination status, exposure history, or herd size. More complex models are used in specific contexts: mixed-effects models handle repeated measures (e.g., growth rates in pigs over time), survival analysis estimates time until an event (e.g., recovery after treatment), and generalized linear models (GLMs) analyze non-normal outcomes like counts or proportions (e.g., number of coughing episodes per day).

Statistical models must be built and interpreted carefully. Analysts need to consider assumptions such as linearity, independence, and equal variance. They must also avoid overfitting, which happens when a model becomes too complex and captures random noise rather than meaningful patterns. Common software tools for modeling include R, SPSS, Stata, and SAS. When properly applied, modeling offers greater flexibility and insight, especially when multiple factors interact to affect animal health or productivity.

## Ethical and practical considerations

Data analysis carries important ethical responsibilities, especially when results guide clinical recommendations, animal health policies, or scientific communication. Researchers must avoid questionable practices such as data dredging—searching through data for statistically significant results without a prior hypothesis—or p-hacking, where analyses are repeatedly adjusted until a desired result is found. For example, a researcher may repeatedly test different age or breed groups until a statistically significant difference in treatment effect emerges, even if the result is not reproducible or meaningful. These actions can lead to misleading conclusions and inappropriate decisions in veterinary care.

In addition, overstating findings or failing to report study limitations can mislead readers. For instance, claiming that a new dietary supplement increases milk production based on a small, underpowered study—without acknowledging variability or uncertainty—may lead to false expectations or misinformed decisions.  Another common issue is choosing the wrong statistical test, which can lead to incorrect conclusions even when data quality is high. For example, using a t-test to compare median body condition scores between two groups, which are ordinal and not normally distributed, would be inappropriate. A non-parametric test such as the Mann–Whitney U test would be a better choice in this case.

Transparency is essential at every step. Researchers should clearly document how data were prepared, which tests or models were used, how assumptions were checked, and how missing values were handled. Analyses should be reproducible, meaning others can verify the results using the same data and methods. On a practical level, researchers should use validated software, apply version control, and seek expert guidance when needed. Ethical, transparent, and well-documented analysis strengthens the credibility of research, protects animal welfare, and upholds the standards of veterinary science.
