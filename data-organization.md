# Data organization

**Data organization** (or **data management**) is the process of arranging and preparing collected data into structured formats—such as tables, datasets, or databases—to support easy access and analysis. It includes key tasks such as entering, cleaning, formatting, and storing data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and reliable interpretation. In veterinary biostatistics, well-organized data are essential for reducing errors, ensuring reproducible research, and supporting valid statistical analysis. Without proper organization, even high-quality data collected from clinics or fieldwork may become difficult to use, potentially leading to flawed conclusions or wasted effort. Data organization forms a crucial bridge between data collection and data analysis.

## Purpose and importance

Organizing data is a crucial step in transforming raw observations into meaningful evidence. It allows researchers to review data systematically, recognize patterns, and detect potential issues early. Well-organized data make it possible to apply statistical procedures correctly and ensure that study results can be verified and reproduced by others. 

In veterinary studies, data often come from many animals, farms, clinics, or time points. Proper organization helps maintain clarity and prevents confusion in such complex settings. Whether the goal is to monitor disease outbreaks, analyze diagnostic test results, or evaluate treatment responses, organized data provide the foundation for sound scientific conclusions.

The data organization process typically involves several key steps. Data entry involves transferring information into a structured format. Data cleaning corrects errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. Data formatting and manipulation prepare the data for analysis by reshaping tables, coding categories, or creating new variables. Data storage and retrieval ensures that datasets are securely saved and easily accessed for future use.

## Data entry

Data entry is the process of transferring information from its original source—such as a paper form, digital sensor, or clinical device—into a structured format suitable for analysis. It is usually the first step in the data organization process and may involve manual typing, importing digital files, or capturing data automatically. The method used depends on how the data were collected and which tools are available for processing them.

In manual data entry, researchers or technicians type information into spreadsheets or data forms. This is common when working with paper-based records, such as clinical notes or field observations. Manual entry requires careful attention to avoid typographical errors, especially in large datasets. Techniques such as double-entry verification and validation rules can help detect mistakes and improve accuracy.

In automated data entry, information is transferred directly from digital instruments—such as temperature sensors, blood analyzers, or wearable monitoring devices—into a structured system. These data are often saved in formats like CSV, Excel, or XML and then imported into statistical software or databases. Semi-automated entry combines both approaches. For example, video recordings of animal behavior may be automatically saved but later reviewed by a person who enters selected data points into a table.

During data entry, the format of the original data affects how much preparation is needed. Structured data—such as those already organized in spreadsheets or databases—are easier to enter and process. They can be sorted, filtered, and analyzed directly using software like R, SPSS, or Excel. or instance, a table showing daily milk yield per cow can be imported directly into statistical programs without major adjustments.

In contrast, unstructured data—such as handwritten notes, clinical narratives, audio recordings, or video files—require additional steps before entry. These data must be converted into structured formats before they can be analyzed. Text may need to be transcribed and categorized (such as converting “chronic lameness” to “lameness: chronic”), images annotated with labels, or audio files processed using specialized software. This conversion process may involve consistent file naming, metadata tagging, and the use of tools like text mining or image recognition to prepare the data for structured entry.

Throughout the data entry process, consistency is essential. Variable names, measurement units, coding schemes, and data formats should be standardized from the beginning. This ensures that all data follow the same structure, making them easier to understand, analyze, and merge—especially in collaborative research or multi-phase studies.

## Data cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of identifying and fixing problems in a dataset to make it accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. It typically addresses four main issues: errors, inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.

Errors are incorrect values that result from mistakes in measurement, recording, or data entry. For example, a calf recorded as having a body temperature of 85 °C is clearly implausible. Researchers should review and cross-check these values, verifying them against original records whenever possible. If the original record also states 85 °C and the true value cannot be confidently determined, the entry should be treated as a missing value. However, if there is strong contextual evidence—such as nearby entries showing 38.5 °C, or a likely decimal point error—the value may be corrected based on biological plausibility or known measurement limits. Any corrections should be transparently documented in a data log, along with a clear explanation of the rationale. When done carefully, such corrections improve data quality without introducing bias.

Inconsistencies occur when the same type of information is entered in different formats or codes. For example, the variable “sex” might be entered as “f”, “F”, “female”, or “2” in different parts of the dataset. These inconsistencies can cause problems during analysis and should be addressed through data harmonization, which involves standardizing values to a consistent format (e.g., recoding all versions of “female” as “F”).

Missing values occur when data for a variable are absent. These can result from equipment failure, animal unavailability, skipped questions, or transcription errors. For example, if body weight was not recorded during a farm visit, that cell in the dataset remains blank. Researchers should assess how much data are missing and whether the missingness appears to be random or systematic. Depending on the context, different strategies may be used:

- Excluding records with missing values. It is straightforward but may reduce statistical power, especially in small datasets.

- Imputing, which refers to the process of estimating and filling in missing data points using statistical methods. This may include replacing a missing value with the mean or median of similar cases, predicting it based on related variables (e.g., estimating weight from age and breed), or using more advanced approaches such as multiple imputation, which generates plausible values using probabilistic models. These methods are valid when applied carefully and must be clearly described in the research documentation.

- Using statistical models that tolerate missing data, such as maximum likelihood estimation or mixed-effects models, can allow incomplete cases to be included in analysis without filling in values.

Duplicates refer to repeated entries that represent the same observation more than once. They can arise from accidental double entry, system errors, or data merging processes. Duplicate records can affect summary statistics, inflate sample sizes, and distort results. For example, if the same cow's weight is entered twice on the same date, it may appear that more data were collected than actually were. Identifying duplicates typically involves checking for repeated combinations of key identifiers (e.g., animal ID, date, and location). Once identified, duplicates should be reviewed and either removed or merged, to ensure that no unique information is accidentally lost.

Data cleaning often overlaps with data validation, which is the process of ensuring that collected data is accurate, complete, and meets specified criteria, such as expected ranges or logical rules. For example, a script might flag any adult goat weighing less than 1 kg or a gestation period that exceeds species norms. These automated checks help identify errors that may not be obvious on first inspection. Ultimately, the goal of data cleaning is not to “perfect” the dataset but to ensure that it reflects the best available version of reality—accurately, transparently, and consistently. Ethical data cleaning avoids the invention or distortion of data and supports the integrity of statistical analysis.

## Data formatting and manipulation

Once the data are cleaned, they must be formatted into structures that can be analyzed efficiently. Data formatting involves arranging data into standardized tables, where each row represents a single observational unit (such as an animal, sample, or farm), and each column represents a variable (such as age, sex, body weight, or diagnosis). This layout is commonly referred to as long format or tidy format, and it is preferred by most statistical software due to its simplicity and flexibility.

Data manipulation refers to any process of modifying, transforming, or restructuring data to prepare it for analysis, visualization, or other uses. This includes a wide range of operations such as converting date fields into durations (e.g., time between two clinical visits), creating new variables (e.g., an ordinal variable indicating whether an animal is underweight, normal, or overweight based on body weight), recoding categories (e.g., grouping rare breeds into an “other” category), or merging multiple tables based on a shared identifier (e.g., animal ID or sample number). Common tasks also include sorting the dataset by specific variables (such as age or weight) to organize records in a meaningful order, and filtering to select only relevant observations (e.g., animals diagnosed with mastitis). These actions help researchers inspect patterns, prepare subsets for analysis, or generate summary reports. All manipulation steps should be transparent and repeatable, with clear documentation of any changes made to the original structure.

Two common table types are important to distinguish during formatting:

- A relational database table (also called a flat or normalized table) is designed for storing structured data efficiently. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a specific attribute or variable. These tables are often used in databases and allow for scalable querying and updating.

- A pivot table,  which is a dynamic table that allows its users to summarize, rearrange, and analyze data in various ways by changing the arrangement of its rows and columns. It acts as a summary table for quick review. It allows users to count, sum, or average variables across categories—for example, calculating the average body weight per breed. Pivot tables are useful for exploration and reporting. However, they are not appropriate for storing raw data or conducting detailed statistical analysis.
