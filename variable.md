# Variable

A variable is a characteristic that can take on different values across individuals, objects, or conditions. In statistical and scientific contexts, variables are used to represent what is being measured, observed, or compared in a study.

While a variable defines what is being recorded, data are the actual recorded values for that variable. The example can be seen in the table below.

| **No.** | **Variables** | **Data**  |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | Name | Anto, Bayu, Cece, Donny |
| 2. | Place of birth (city or regency) | Maros, Makassar, Medan, Merauke |
| 3. | Body temperature (Â°C) | 36.8, 36.6, 37.0, 36.4 |
| 4. | Last meal this morning | Noodle, Fried Rice, Meatballs, No meal |
| 5. | Blood glucose levels (mg/dl) | 83, 94, 86, 72 |

Variables can be classified in several ways. Based on data type, they may be categorical (e.g., breed, sex, disease status) or numerical (e.g., age, body weight, temperature). In research design, they may also be described as independent variables (those manipulated or categorized to observe effects) and dependent variables (those measured as outcomes).

Understanding variables is essential for designing studies, organizing data, and conducting statistical analysis. Clear definition and consistent measurement of variables are critical for producing valid, interpretable results in both clinical and research settings.
