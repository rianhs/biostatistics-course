# Statistic

In [statistics](statistics.md), a **statistic** is a numerical value calculated from data collected from a [sample](sample.md). It summarizes or describes a characteristic of that sample—such as the average body temperature of 50 cats examined at a clinic, the proportion of vaccinated animals in a selected group of farms, or the median age of dogs in a shelter. Unlike [parameters](parameter.md), statistics are computed directly from observed data and vary from one sample to another. They are used both for descriptive purposes and as estimates of corresponding [population](population.md) parameters, making them fundamental tools in both descriptive and inferential statistics.

## Relationship with parameter

Parameters and statistics are closely related in the logic of statistical inference. A parameter describes a characteristic of a population, while a statistic is the corresponding value calculated from a sample. Because researchers rarely have access to entire populations, statistics are used to estimate parameters and support generalizations about the population.

Although parameters and statistics describe the same types of characteristics —such as means, proportions, and standard deviations—they differ in both their source (population vs. sample) and notation. The table below shows common examples:

| Characteristic | Parameter (population) | Statistic (sample) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Size (number of units) | 𝑁 | 𝑛 |
| Mean | μ (mu) | 𝑥̅ (x-bar) |
| Proportion | P | 𝑝̅ (p-hat) |
| Standard deviation | σ (sigma) | s |
| Variance | σ² | s² |

While parameters are theoretical values that describe entire populations, statistics are calculated from sample data and serve as estimates of those parameters. This relationship forms the foundation of inferential statistics, which uses sample information to draw conclusions about broader populations.
