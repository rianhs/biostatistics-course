# Data presentation

**Data presentation** is the process of displaying and communicating analyzed and interpreted [data](data.md) in a clear and effective format to an audience. It represents the final step in the statistical workflow—translating complex results into forms that are understandable, relevant, and useful for researchers, clinicians, policymakers, or the general public. In [veterinary biostatistics](veterinary-biostatistics.md), effective data presentation promotes transparency, supports decision-making, and improves understanding of animal health patterns, treatment outcomes, and research conclusions. A well-presented dataset not only conveys results accurately but also helps audiences understand their significance and practical implications.

## Purpose and importance

Data presentation plays a critical role in the research process. It transforms statistical results into formats that are easy to interpret and tailored to the needs of the intended audience. Its main purpose is to communicate findings clearly, truthfully, and efficiently—whether to inform clinical decisions, support scientific arguments, or influence policy and practice.

Clear presentation enhances understanding, emphasizes key findings, and allows others to assess the quality and relevance of the research. In veterinary contexts, this might involve summarizing disease trends for veterinarians, reporting study results to farm managers, or presenting surveillance data to policymakers. Poorly presented data—such as cluttered tables, misleading graphs, or ambiguous labels—can confuse readers, obscure important patterns, and reduce the impact of the research.

Well-designed data presentation bridges the gap between technical analysis and real-world applications. It ensures that results are not only statistically valid but also visually clear and contextually meaningful.

## Types

Data can be presented in various ways, depending on the nature of the data, the audience, and the message the researcher intends to communicate. The three main forms of data presentation are tables, visualizations, and narrative summaries.

- Tables organize data into rows and columns, making it easy to present exact numerical values and categorical information. They are especially useful for detailed comparisons—such as descriptive statistics or the results of diagnostic tests. For example, a table might show the average body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate across different treatment groups of cattle. Tables are well suited for technical readers who need exact values.

- Graphs and charts (also called visualizations or plots) are used to highlight patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. They are ideal for summarizing large datasets, comparing groups, showing distributions, or displaying changes over time. Common examples include bar charts, histograms, line charts, scatter plots, and box plots. Maps are also widely used to show geographic patterns. In addition, diagrams such as flowcharts or conceptual models may be included to explain procedures or study designs. Graphical presentations are effective for general audiences or for illustrating complex relationships in a concise and intuitive way.

- Narrative summaries describe the data in plain text. They are often used to highlight key findings in a clear and concise format. For example, a narrative might describe how treated calves gained more weight than controls or how disease prevalence declined after vaccination. This presentation style is especially useful in reports, abstracts, and communication with non-specialist audiences, where clarity and brevity are more important than technical detail.

Each type of presentation plays a role in communicating scientific findings. Researchers often combine tables, visuals, and narrative explanations to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-understand picture of their results. Choosing the appropriate format depends on the purpose of the presentation and the needs of the intended audience. For technical readers, detailed tables and plots with statistical annotations may be appropriate. For general or policy audiences, simple visuals with clear labeling and minimal jargon may be more effective.

## Design principles

Effective data presentation relies on thoughtful design. Whether using tables, graphs, or narrative text, the main goal is to make the information easy to read, understand, and interpret. Poor design can mislead the audience or obscure the key findings, even when the data themselves are valid. Several core principles can help improve presentation quality: clarity, consistency, proper labeling, simplicity, and proportionality.

Clarity means ensuring that the main message is easy to recognize. This involves avoiding unnecessary detail, reducing visual clutter, and emphasizing the most important information. Consistency involves using the same units, colors, scales, and terminology throughout the presentation, helping the reader navigate the information more easily. Labels must be complete and clear. Every figure or table should have a meaningful title, and all axes, rows, columns, and legends should include appropriate labels and measurement units. Simplicity improves readability—design elements such as 3D effects, shading, or decorative graphics should be avoided if they do not improve comprehension. Proportionality ensures that the visual representation matches the data. For example, if one bar in a chart is twice as tall as another, it should represent a value that is twice as large.

When these design principles are applied consistently, data presentation becomes not only more attractive but also more scientifically trustworthy and easier for others to interpret accurately.

## Narrative and contextual elements

Graphs and tables are essential tools for summarizing data, but they are most effective when accompanied by clear narrative explanations. Narrative text guides the reader, highlights key patterns, and connects visual elements to the broader research context. Simply presenting a table or figure without interpretation may leave the audience uncertain about its meaning or relevance.

A strong narrative introduces each visual by explaining what it shows and why it matters. It then draws attention to meaningful trends, differences, or relationships that answer the research question. For example, if a line graph displays weekly weight gain in two treatment groups of calves, the accompanying text might note that both groups gained weight over time, but the treated group began to show greater gains after the third week. This type of explanation helps the reader focus on the most important findings without overstating the results.

Narratives should be objective, concise, and based on the data. They must avoid speculation or claims that go beyond the evidence. In veterinary science—where decisions can affect animal welfare, clinical practices, or public perception—accurate and transparent explanation are essential to support responsible use of the findings.

## Common mistakes

Even well-analyzed data can be misrepresented through poor visual design or communication. Some common mistakes to avoid are:

- Inappropriate chart type: Using the wrong chart type can confuse readers or misinterpret the data. For example, a pie chart with many small slices is difficult to interpret. In such cases, a bar chart or table might be more appropriate.

- Missing or unclear labels: All axes, units, titles, and legends should be clearly labeled. Without this information, readers may misinterpret the data or fail to understand what is being shown.

- Overcomplicating visuals: Figures with too many categories, colors, or data series can overwhelm the reader and dilute the main message. Simple visuals are often more effective, especially when only a few key variables need to be emphasized.

- Distorted scales: Altering the axes—such as starting the y-axis above zero or using uneven intervals—can exaggerate or minimize differences and mislead the audience.

- Redundant information: Repeating the same data in multiple formats (such as presenting both a full table and a bar chart with identical values) can clutter the report unless each format provides a unique perspective.

- Lack of integration with the narrative: Figures and tables should be clearly introduced and discussed in the text. Without explanation, visuals may seem unrelated and leave readers unsure of their meaning or relevance.

Avoiding these common mistake helps ensure that the data presentation serves its primary purpose: to support accurate, clear, and effective communication of scientific results.

## Ethical and practical considerations

Presenting data is not just a technical task—it is also an ethical responsibility. Researchers must ensure that figures, tables, and accompanying narratives are truthful, transparent, and scientifically sound.

A core principle is accuracy. All visual elements should truthfully represent the data without manipulation or distortion. For example, adjusting the scale of a graph to exaggerate differences or leaving out unfavorable data points can mislead readers and undermine scientific integrity. Closely related is the use of data transformations, groupings, or simplifications in visualizations. These should always be clearly explained so that the audience understands how the information was obtained.

Selective reporting is another issue. Highlighting only statistically significant findings while ignoring contradictory or non-significant results introduces bias and creates an incomplete view of the evidence. All relevant results—positive, negative, or neutral—should be presented to provide a complete and balanced view.

Data privacy must also be protected, especially in studies involving client-owned animals, farms, or sensitive geographic locations. Identifiable data should be anonymized, and researchers must follow ethical guidelines and institutional policies for data sharing and publication.

Audience awareness is a key practical consideration. The language, format, and level of detail should be tailored to the needs of the audience—whether they are veterinarians, scientists, policymakers, or animal owners. For example, technical reports may use detailed tables and statistical notations, while farmer outreach materials may rely on clear visuals and plain language.

Finally, all sources of data and visual elements must be properly cited. If figures are adapted from previous studies or external datasets, this must be clearly acknowledged.
