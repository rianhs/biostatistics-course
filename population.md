# Population

In [statistics](statistics.md), a **population** refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, measurements, or events that share specific characteristics and are the focus of a study. It represents the full set from which data could be collected and about which conclusions are intended to be drawn. Depending on the research question, a population may consist of animals, farms, biological specimens, clinical measurements, or health-related events. For example, a population might include all laying hens on a farm, all cats treated at veterinary clinics within a year, or all confirmed cases of canine parvovirus reported in a province. A well-defined population is essential because it determines the scope of the study and clarifies what the findings are meant to represent.

## Defining the population in research

In any statistical investigation, the first step is to define the population clearly and precisely. A well-defined population provides the basis for appropriate data collection and valid interpretation. This definition usually includes biological characteristics (such as species, breed, age, or health status), geographic location (such as farms in a particular province or animals in selected veterinary clinics), time period (such as cases recorded between January and June 2025), and other traits relevant to the study’s objectives.

To improve clarity and consistency, researchers often specify inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria describe the characteristics that individuals or units must have to be included in the population. For example, the study might include only animals older than one year, or farms that use pasture-based feeding systems. Exclusion criteria, on the other hand, identify features that disqualify individuals who otherwise meet the inclusion criteria. These might include a specific pre-existing condition (such as chronic lameness or prior vaccination for the disease under study) or missing or incomplete health records. Together, these criteria ensure that the population is appropriate for the research question and improve the consistency and quality of the data collected.

A vague definition such as “all cows in Indonesia” may be too broad to implement effectively. In contrast, a more precise and useful definition might be “all lactating Holstein-Friesian cows in commercial dairy farms in East Java between January and June 2025.” This level of specificity, supported by clearly stated inclusion and exclusion criteria, enables focused data collection and meaningful analysis.

## Census, sampling, and generalization

Researchers may attempt to collect data from the entire population through a census, or from a subset of the population through sampling. In practice, a census is rarely feasible for large populations because of time, cost, or logistical constraints. For this reason, most studies rely on sampling methods to obtain data from a smaller group that represents the population.

Sampling is only effective when the population is clearly and specifically defined. The [sample](sample.md) must reflect the characteristics of the larger group to allow valid generalizations. In most cases, the aim of inferential statistics is to analyze sample data and draw conclusions about the broader population.

## Target population and study population

It is useful to distinguish between the target population and the study population. The target population refers to the entire group to which the researcher intends to generalize the findings. This population is defined conceptually and includes all individuals who meet the inclusion criteria, whether or not they are accessible for study.

The study population is the portion of the target population that is actually accessible for data collection. It may be limited by factors such as geography, time, infrastructure, or data availability. For example, the target population might be all backyard chickens in South Sulawesi Province, while the study population includes only chickens in ten selected cities and regencies where field surveys can be conducted.

This distinction is important because differences between the target and study populations affect how broadly the findings can be generalized. A well-documented definition of both groups enhances the transparency and external validity of the research.
