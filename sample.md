# Sample

In [statistics](statistics.md), a **sample** is a subset of individuals, objects, or observations selected from a larger [population](population.md) for the purpose of study or analysis. It provides a manageable representation of the population, especially when collecting data from every member—a census—is impractical or impossible. By studying a sample, researchers aim to draw conclusions about the entire population based on the characteristics observed within that smaller group.

The usefulness of a sample depends on how well it represents the population from which it is drawn. If selected appropriately, a sample captures the essential variation and structure of the population, allowing for accurate and meaningful generalizations. This process is central to statistical inference, where sample-based values (called statistics) are used to estimate corresponding population characteristics (called parameters). Understanding the relationship between a sample, its population, and the conclusions drawn from data is essential for evaluating the strength and reliability of a study.

Samples are used in nearly all areas of veterinary and biomedical research. For example, a sample might include 100 dogs selected from all dogs treated at a veterinary hospital in 2024, or 20 farms chosen from a region’s full list of dairy producers. In laboratory settings, a sample could consist of 50 blood specimens drawn from a larger herd. Sampling design includes the calculation of sample size (the number of individuals to be selected) and the choice of a sampling technique (how those individuals are chosen from the population).
