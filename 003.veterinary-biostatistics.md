# Veterinary biostatistics

**Veterinary biostatistics** is the application of statistical methods to research and data analysis in veterinary medicine and animal health sciences. As a subfield of [biostatistics](002.biostatistics.md), it supports the design of studies, evaluation of treatments, and interpretation of data in settings involving animals—both domestic and wild—at both individual and population levels.

Veterinary biostatistics plays a central role in clinical research involving companion, production, and wild animals. It is used to assess the efficacy and safety of veterinary interventions, to develop diagnostic tools, and to analyze patterns of disease in animal populations. In veterinary epidemiology, it contributes to the surveillance of infectious diseases, the modeling of transmission dynamics, and the identification of risk factors affecting animal health, welfare, and productivity.

Although it draws on the same statistical principles used in human health research, veterinary biostatistics faces challenges unique to animal studies. These include limited sample sizes, species-specific biological variation, and ethical constraints in the use of animals in research. In addition, veterinary data are often organized in clustered or hierarchical structures—such as animals grouped within herds, flocks, or veterinary practices—which require specialized statistical approaches.

The contributions of veterinary biostatistics extend beyond animal health. Its applications also support broader public health goals, especially in areas where human and animal health intersect, such as zoonotic disease prevention, food safety, and One Health initiatives.
