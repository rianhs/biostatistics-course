# Biostatistics

**Biostatistics** is a specialized branch of [statistics](statistics.md) that applies statistical methods to the analysis of [data](data.md) in biology, medicine, and public health. It is a key tool for understanding biological processes, designing scientific studies, and making evidence-based decisions in the life and health sciences. Positioned at the intersection of statistics and biology, biostatistics combines mathematical rigor with biological insight to support research across a wide range of scientific fields.

## Relationship to statistics and biology
Biostatistics arises from the integration of statistical theory with biological inquiry. It is grounded in core statistical principles such as probability, estimation, and inference, but it is shaped by the unique characteristics of biological data. These include variability in living systems, ethical limitations in experimentation, and complex relationships between biological variables. Biostatistics supports both observational and experimental research and plays a central role in turning biological data into scientific understanding.

## Scope and role
Biostatistics is essential in health-related disciplines such as epidemiology, clinical research, pharmacology, and public health. It is used to design clinical trials, determine appropriate sample sizes, analyze treatment effects, and evaluate health outcomes. In public health, biostatistical methods help monitor disease outbreaks, identify risk factors, and measure the impact of interventions.

Its applications extend beyond human health. Biostatistics is also used in fields such as ecology, evolutionary biology, agriculture, genetics, and veterinary science. It supports the study of population dynamics, genetic variation, and environmental influences on living organisms. Across these diverse areas, biostatistics provides the methodological framework for rigorous and reproducible scientific analysis.

## Challenges and considerations
Biostatistics faces unique challenges due to the complexity of biological systems. Confounding variables, small or diverse sample sizes, and missing or incomplete data often require careful planning and specialized methods. Biological data may also violate standard assumptions used in statistical models, making adjustments or alternative techniques necessary.

Ethical concerns are especially significant in biostatistics, particularly in research involving human participants. Biostatisticians must ensure that data are handled responsibly, that individual privacy is protected, and that results are presented honestly and transparently. As biological data grow in volume and complexity—from genomics to environmental monitoring—the field increasingly relies on advanced computational tools and close collaboration across scientific disciplines.
