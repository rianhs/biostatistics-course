# Descriptive statistics

**Descriptive statistics** is a branch of [statistics](statistics.md) that focuses on summarizing and describing the main characteristics of a data set. It provides a clear overview of the data using numerical summaries, tables, and visualizations, helping researchers identify patterns and trends without making generalizations beyond the observed [sample](sample.md). Descriptive methods are essential for detecting central tendencies, measuring variation, and communicating results clearly and accurately. For example, in a commercial chicken farm, descriptive statistics might be used to report the average weight of broiler chickens at market age, the number of eggs laid per day across henhouses, or how barn temperatures fluctuate during the week. These summaries offer important insights into the structure and quality of the data and often serve as a foundation for further analysis, such as [inferential statistics](inferential-statistics.md).

## Measures of central tendency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Main article: [Measures of central tendency](measures-of-central-tendency.md)*

Measures of central tendency describe the center of a data set—the value that best represents the available data. The most commonly used measures are the mean, median, and mode, each offering a different perspective.

Suppose a farmer records the weights (in kilograms) of five chickens: 1.9, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, and 4.1 kg. The mean, or average, is calculated by summing all values (12.0 kg) and dividing by the number of chickens (5), resulting in a mean weight of 2.4 kg. However, the relatively high value of 4.1 kg increases the mean, making it less representative of most chickens in the sample.

The median is the middle value when the data are ordered. In this case, the median is 2.0 kg, which better represents the center of the distribution, especially in the presence of an outlier.

The mode is the value that occurs most frequently. Here, the mode is 1.9 kg, since it appears twice, while the other values each occur once. This indicates that 1.9 kg is the most common weight among the five chickens.

In this example, the mean, median, and mode are all different, showing how each measure provides unique insight. Choosing the most appropriate one depends on the shape of the distribution and the presence of extreme values.

## Measures of variability
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Main article: [Measures of variability](measures-of-variability.md)*

While measures of central tendency summarize the center of the data, measures of variability (or dispersion) describe how spread out the data are. They indicate whether the values are tightly clustered around the center or widely dispersed.

Consider a set of daily barn temperatures (in °C) recorded over one week: 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, and 34. The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, is 34 − 23 = 11 °C. This gives a basic sense of the spread, but it is sensitive to extreme values.

The mean temperature for this data set is approximately 25.86 °C. Using standard formulas for a sample, the sample variance is 13.81, and the sample standard deviation is approximately 3.72 °C. This means that, on average, daily temperatures deviate about 3.72 °C from the mean. The relatively large spread is influenced by the unusually high value of 34 °C. These statistics are often expressed as 25.86 ± 3.72 °C, indicating both the center and the variability.

Another useful measure is the interquartile range (IQR), which describes the spread of the middle 50% of the data. In this example, the first quartile (Q1) is 24 °C, and the third quartile (Q3) is 25.5 °C. The IQR is calculated as Q3 − Q1 = 1.5 °C. Since the IQR focuses on the central portion of the data, it is less affected by outliers and provides a robust indicator of variability around the median (25 °C).

Understanding these measures helps researchers evaluate how consistent or variable the data are. This, in turn, informs decisions about data quality and the suitability of different statistical techniques.

## Data visualization
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Main article: [Data visualization](data-visualization.md)*

In addition to numerical summaries, descriptive statistics often use visual tools to present data in a clear and intuitive way. Graphs and charts help highlight trends, reveal patterns, and identify potential errors or outliers.

For instance, a bar chart might be used to compare the number of hens laying 0, 1, 2, or 3 eggs on a given day. This makes it easy to see which egg-laying frequency is most common. A histogram could show the distribution of chicken weights at slaughter, revealing whether the weights are normally distributed or skewed toward lighter or heavier birds.

A box plot could be used to visualize the weekly barn temperatures. It would show the median, quartiles, and potential outliers—such as an unusually high reading (34 °C) on one day—providing a compact summary of both center and spread. Similarly, a scatter plot might show the relationship between feed intake and weight gain, helping to identify trends or correlations. 

These visualizations not only support analysis but also improve communication, especially when presenting findings to non-specialist audiences.

## Role in statistical practice

Descriptive statistics is a fundamental part of the statistical process. It is often the first step in any data analysis, serving to explore the data and assess its quality. By summarizing large amounts of data into meaningful numbers and images, descriptive statistics make complex information easier to interpret and communicate. 

In veterinary and animal health research, descriptive statistics are routinely used to report clinical findings, summarize production metrics, and compare data across time periods or study groups. For example, a study might report the average daily weight gain of broiler chickens, the proportion of animals affected by respiratory illness, or the weekly variation in barn humidity. These summaries can guide practical decisions even before formal hypothesis testing is conducted. 

Although descriptive statistics do not support generalizations beyond the data set at hand, they provide essential context for interpreting results and are foundational for all other statistical methods, including inferential statistics.
