# Data interpretation

**Data interpretation** is the process of assigning meaning to analyzed [data](data.md) in order to draw conclusions, uncover insights, and support decision-making. It involves evaluating statistical results in the context of the original research question, study design, and real-world relevance. In [veterinary biostatistics](veterinary-biostatistics.md), interpretation helps translate numbers into knowledge—whether to understand disease patterns, assess treatment effects, or inform animal health policies. This step occurs after [data analysis](data-analysis.md) and before [data presentation](data-presentation.md), ensuring that findings are not only statistically valid but also scientifically meaningful and clearly understood.

## Purpose and importance

The purpose of data interpretation is to transform statistical results into meaningful conclusions that address the research objectives. While data analysis provides numerical outputs—such as means, p-values, or regression coefficients—interpretation provides context to these numbers. It helps answers questions like: *What does this difference mean in practice? Is the result biologically relevant? Does it support or refute the hypothesis?*

In veterinary research, interpretation connects statistical analysis to real-world application. For example, a statistically significant increase in weight gain among treated calves is only useful if the increase is large enough to be biologically or economically important. Interpretation ensures that results are evaluated based on of clinical practice, animal health, and study goals—not just statistical criteria.

## Contextualizing results

Interpreting results requires understanding not only the numbers but also the context of the study. Researchers must consider the research question, the population studied, the sampling method, the measurement tool, and any limitations in the design or implementation.

For example, a study might show that a vaccine reduces respiratory disease in dairy cows. However, the interpretation depends on the details: Were the cows randomly assigned to the treatment? Was the sample representative of the broader population? Did the results truly reflect the severity of the disease?

Without this context, results can be misunderstood or misused. A small but statistically significant difference may not justify a change in management practice if the effect is clinically trivial. For instance, if a new supplement increases daily weight gain in piglets by only 10 grams—while requiring substantial cost or labor—it may not be worth implementing despite being “statistically significant.” 

Conversely, a finding that is not statistically significant might still suggest an important trend. For example, a study involving a small sample of calves may show lower mortality in the treatment group, but without reaching statistical significance—possibly due to insufficient power. However, the result could justify further investigation in a follow-up study with a larger sample size.

## Interpreting common statistical outputs

Several common statistical results are central to data interpretation. Understanding what these values mean—and what they do not mean—is essential for drawing correct conclusions.

- P-values indicate the probability of observing the data (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests evidence against the null hypothesis. However, it does not measure the size or importance of an effect. For example, a p-value of 0.03 when comparing body temperatures in two cat groups shows a statistically significant difference—but we still need to assess whether that difference matters clinically.

- Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. They provide more information than p-values by showing the estimate and its precision. For example, if the 95% confidence interval for the average milk production per cow is 27.5 to 28.0 liters, we can be confident that the true mean lies within this narrow range. In contrast, a wider interval (e.g., 25.0 to 30.5 liters) reflects more uncertainty.

- Effect size describes the magnitude of a difference or relationship—such as a mean difference, odds ratio, or correlation coefficient. Effect size helps assess practical importance. For example, if a treatment shortens the duration of diarrhea in calves by 1.8 days, this may be clinically meaningful depending on the context.

Regression coefficients indicate how changes in one variable are associated with changes in an outcome, holding other variables constant. For example, in a model predicting milk production, a regression coefficient of 0.3 for feed intake means that every additional kilogram of feed is associated with a 0.3-liter increase in milk production, assuming other factors remain constant. If a second coefficient (e.g., for temperature) is negative, it might indicate that milk production decreases as temperature rises—helping identify environmental influences.

Proper interpretation of these outputs ensures that conclusions are based not only on statistical thresholds, but also on meaningful scientific reasoning.

## Biological and clinical relevance

Statistical significance does not always mean that a finding is biologically or clinically important. A small difference may reach statistical significance in a large sample but have little practical impact. On the other hand, a moderate effect that does not reach statistical significance—perhaps due to a small sample size—may still be biologically meaningful and deserve further investigation.

In veterinary medicine, results must be interpreted in the context of animal health, welfare, and management. For example, a treatment that reduces calf mortality by just 1% could be highly valuable in large herds or low-resource settings, even if the p-value is on the borderline. Similarly, an intervention that significantly increases feed intake might not be useful if it leads to minimal weight gain or increased  feeding costs.

Interpretation should consider not only the magnitude of the effect but also the feasibility, cost, risks, and broader implications in veterinary practice. Aligning statistical results with biological and clinical relevance strengthens both the usefulness and trustworthiness of veterinary research.

## Common mistakes

Data misinterpretation is a common problem, which often caused by misunderstandings of statistical concepts. Some frequent mistakes include:

- Equating statistical significance with practical importance: A p-value below 0.05 does not necessarily mean the result is biologically meaningful or practically useful. For example, a 0.2 kg increase in piglet weight may be statistically significant in a large sample but irrelevant for farm productivity.

- Ignoring effect sizes and confidence intervals: Focusing only on whether a result is “significant” can overlook how large or precise the effect is. These metrics are often more informative than the p-value alone.

- Assuming causation from correlation: A relationship between two variables—such as feed type and milk production—does not prove that one causes the other. There may be confounding factors, such as herd size or management practices.

- Overgeneralizing findings: Results from a specific population or context should not be assumed to apply universally. For example, a treatment that is effective in one breed or environment may not work the same way in another breed or environment.

- Cherry-picking results: Selecting only favorable or statistically significant findings to report (while ignoring others) introduces bias and misleads readers.

Being aware of these mistakes helps researchers draw more balanced and defensible conclusions, reducing the risk of errors in clinical or policy applications.

## Ethical and practical considerations

Data interpretation comes with ethical and practical responsibilities. It requires more than just correct analysis—it demands transparency, honesty, and a commitment to scientific integrity. This is especially important in veterinary research, where interpretation can influence animal welfare, public health, and policy.

One essential consideration is the recognition of limitations and uncertainty. No dataset is perfect, and every study involves constraints. Sources of uncertainty may include sampling error, measurement inaccuracies, confounding variables, and missing data. For example, a study on parasite prevalence in smallholder goat farms may have gaps due to inaccessible or non-participating farms. These limitations can reduce the strength of conclusions and must be acknowledged.

Statistical results—such as confidence intervals, p-values, and standard errors—help quantify uncertainty but cannot eliminate it. Researchers should ask critical questions: *How confident are we in this result? Could it have occurred by chance? Are there alternative explanations?* Clearly communicating these uncertainties encourages more cautious and thoughtful interpretation and promotes scientific transparency.

Ethical interpretation also means reporting results honestly and responsibly. Exaggerating findings or making unsupported claims is misleading. For instance, claiming that a supplement “prevents disease” based on a small pilot study with modest effects is inappropriate. Similarly, downplaying negative findings or selectively highlighting favorable ones distorts the scientific record.

When results are preliminary, uncertain, or based on limited evidence, this should be openly stated. Peer reviewers, journal editors, and readers depend on accurate interpretation to assess the credibility and value of a study. Ultimately, ethical and careful interpretation strengthens veterinary science. It ensures that research-based decisions—whether in the clinic, on the farm, or in policy—are based on truth, responsibility, and scientific rigor.
